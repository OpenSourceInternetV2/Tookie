With a rag-tag crew at his side (Martin Freeman, Brendan Gleeson, Russell Tovey, and Ashley Jensen), and seemingly blind to the impossible odds stacked against him, the Captain has one dream: to beat his bitter rivals Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) and Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek) to the much coveted Pirate Of The Year Award. It‚Äôs a quest that takes our heroes from the shores of exotic Blood Island to the foggy streets of Victorian London. Along the way they battle a diabolical queen (Imelda Staunton) and team up with a haplessly smitten young scientist (David Tennant), but never lose sight of what a pirate loves best: adventure!","genre":"Adventure","poster":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/i0nT0wrtn2o6n6lABU4J5EOxtGo.jpg","rating":7,"release_date":"2012-03-28","format":"dvd rip","id":87},{"url":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:969631BA61322F36C0498A5DF9FD73E79A5F82D0&dn=Girls.Gone.Dead.2012.UNRATED.HDRip.XviD-HS&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ffr33dom.h33t.com%3A3310%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ffr33dom.h33t.com%3A3310%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fcpleft.com%3A2710%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fipv4.tracker.harry.lu%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.ex.ua%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.torrentbay.to%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.1337x.org%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ffr33domtracker.h33t.com%3A3310%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.ccc.de%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.istole.it%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2F9.rarbg.com%3A2710%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2F10.rarbg.com%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80%2Fannounce","title":"Girls Gone Dead","description":"","genre":"Comedy","poster":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/1J8CR2zWRONBH6JTgs8ZtKMpDca.jpg","rating":0,"release_date":"2012-03-28","format":"dvd rip","id":106},{"url":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:78D997095C0F2AEB4873619AA838525A89030B2A&dn=Wild+Bill+2012+LIMITED+DVDRip+XviD-DoNE&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.1337x.org%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ffr33dom.h33t.com%3A3310%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fipv4.tracker.harry.lu%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.istole.it%3A80&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fcpleft.com%3A2710%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publicbt.com%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Finferno.demonoid.me%3A3390%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.ccc.de%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2F11.rarbg.com%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.ex.ua%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2F9.rarbg.com%3A2710%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2F10.rarbg.com%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.pow7.com%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.torrentbay.to%3A6969%2Fannounce","title":"Wild Bill","description":"Out on parole after 8 years inside Bill Hayward returns home to find his now 11 and 15 year old sons abandoned by their mother and fending for themselves.

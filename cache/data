It was summer 1999 when four small-town Michigan boys began a quest to lose their virginity. In the years that have passed, Jim and Michelle married while Kevin and Vicky said goodbye. Oz and Heather grew apart, but Finch still longs for Stifler’s mom. Now these lifelong friends have come home as adults to reminisce about - and get inspired by - the hormonal teens who launched a comedy legend.","genre":"Comedy","poster":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/rdRnt7W6QwdY2jEddOr0c1CXMmn.jpg","rating":7.5,"release_date":"2012-04-06","format":"screener","id":92,"cast":"Seann William Scott, Mena Suvari, Shannon Elizabeth, Tara Reid, Alyson Hannigan"},{"url":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:95D059E4A26A5244A2E6B519CD65F0D4619B97B9&dn=StreetDance.2.DVDRip.XviD-DoNE&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ffr33dom.h33t.com%3A3310%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ffr33dom.h33t.com%3A3310%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fcpleft.com%3A2710%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.ex.ua%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.torrentbay.to%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.1337x.org%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ffr33domtracker.h33t.com%3A3310%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.ccc.de%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2F11.rarbg.com%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2F9.rarbg.com%3A2710%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2F10.rarbg.com%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80%2Fannounce","title":"Street Dance 2","description":"After suffering humiliation by the crew Invincible, street dancer Ash (Hentschel) looks to gather the best dancers from around the world for a rematch.","genre":"Drama","poster":"http://cf2.imgobject.com/t/p/w342/6b5TakkhVZ6sYqjgoiEOh4INKmm.jpg","rating":0,"release_date":"2012-03-30","format":"dvd rip","id":105,"cast":"Tom Conti, George Sampson, Sofia Boutella, Falk Hentschel, Stephanie Nguyen"},{"url":"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:8B11BC66F1A77433687989DF7D0AB67D44F0077E&dn=Wrath.Of.The.Titans.2012.720p.BluRay.x264.DTS-HDChina+%5BPublicHD%5D&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ffr33dom.h33t.com%3A3310%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publichd.eu%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publichd.eu%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.publicbt.com%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ffr33domtracker.h33t.com%3A3310%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.prq.to%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fipv4.tracker.harry.lu%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.1337x.org%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.ccc.de%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.istole.it%3A80%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2F10.rarbg.com%2Fannounce","title":"Wrath of the Titans","description":"A decade after his heroic defeat of the monstrous Kraken, Perseus-the demigod son of Zeus-is attempting to live a quieter life as a village fisherman and the sole parent to his 10-year old son, Helius.

With a rag-tag crew at his side (Martin Freeman, Brendan Gleeson, Russell Tovey, and Ashley Jensen), and seemingly blind to the impossible odds stacked against him, the Captain has one dream: to beat his bitter rivals Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) and Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek) to the much coveted Pirate Of The Year Award. It’s a quest that takes our heroes from the shores of exotic Blood Island to the foggy streets of Victorian London.
